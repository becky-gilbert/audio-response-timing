Testing the timing accuracy and precision of audio/spoken responses in JavaScript. Written using the [jsPsych framework](https://www.jspsych.org/).
* "Standard" method: Start audio recording and display the stimulus at the same time. Use the start of the audio file as the stim onset time, and calculate audio RT as the delay between the start of the audio file and audio response onset.
* "Start recording first" method: Start audio recording first and get a timestamp, then display the image and get timestamp. Save the difference between timestamps in the data, and calculate audio RT by subtracting the difference between audio recording and image display from the duration between the start of the audio file and the audio response onset.
